            <p style="font-size:120%;">The L Train: My Constant</p>

            The L train is my New York. To me what makes someone's New York is their routine, the start and end to their days, what they will always have and always be able to count on. <br>
            New Yorkers rely on consistency. New Yorkers rely on buying their iced coffee at the same small coffee shop by the corner and getting on the same train and saying hi to the same co-worker the second they enter the office. This routine keeps them stable, keeps them from suddenly ordering from the Thai place they don’t normally order from. <br>
            New York City is easily one of the most hectic cities in the world yet those who live here are always striving for consistency. The city has so much to offer, so why is it that New Yorkers need to go to the same bagel shop every morning? <br>
            It is so easy to get lost, both physically and mentally, in such a big city. Personally I always find myself feeling overwhelmed with all the opportunities, so many places to go and things to do. You will never run out of things to do in the city. There is always a new restaurant to try, a new store to visit, a new bookstore to browse. Without the stability of your favorite restaurant, the store you love, and the bookstore where you had your first job, you will get lost. If you didn't have this stability, you might as well be a tourist because you wouldn't really be living in New York.<br>
            Although this feeling of getting lost is stressful, it is important sometimes, it keeps us human. It teaches us the value of stability. When we are lost we need our routines to keep us grounded. <br>
            As a teenager living in the city, it is incredibly easy to lose yourself. There are so many opportunities and it is easy to feel like you are never doing enough. You see people around you succeeding and doing all these amazing things so you try to do more, become a better version of yourself. That is where you begin the fall. It's impossible to keep up with what everyone else seems to be doing so you sign up for every activity you find until it becomes too much. And then you are lost. Because ultimately getting lost in the city isn’t taking the wrong train, it is being overwhelmed. <br>
            Every morning I walk to the L train. Every morning I speed walk to the station and every morning I wave to the crossing guard. I reload the page with train times frantically even if I know I’ll make the train. I look at the C-Town and the new barber shop and the pharmacy. <br>
            This is my routine. I rely on the fact that I know exactly when my train is coming and if I can afford to miss that light or not. I rely on the fact that if I run fast enough I can turn that four minute walk into a two minute walk. My routine keeps me grounded, keeps me from being stressed and missing my trains. Even though the L runs every six minutes and I wouldn’t have to wait all that long, this routine is important to me. Sprinting down the stairs and shoving myself onto a way too full train is something that I rely on. Everyone on that train is uncomfortable and squished and doesn’t have enough of their own air to breathe but that's how it is, that's how it has always been, and that’s how it will continue to be, because waiting for the next train is way out of the question. <br>
